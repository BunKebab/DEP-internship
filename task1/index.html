          <h3>Introduction to Chess</h3>
          <p>
            Chess is a strategic board game that has been played for centuries.
            It is a two-player game where each player controls an army of pieces
            with the goal of checkmating the opponent's king. Originating in
            India around the 6th century, chess has evolved into a game of skill
            and strategy enjoyed worldwide.

                Setup: The chessboard is set up with each player's pieces on the
                two rows closest to them. The back row should be Rook, Knight,
                Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook from left to right,
                and pawns on the row in front.
              </li>
              <li>
                Objective: The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king,
                putting it under threat of capture with no legal moves to
                escape.

                    <li>
                      Castling: Move the king two squares towards a rook, and
                      the rook moves to the square over which the king crossed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      En Passant: A pawn capturing a pawn that has moved two
                      squares forward from its starting position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Promotion: A pawn reaching the opponent's back row can be
                      promoted to any other piece, typically a queen.

              <li>
                <strong>King Safety:</strong> Ensure your king is safe,

              Chess notation is a system used to record and describe the moves
              in a game. Each square on the board is identified by a unique
              coordinate. For example, the bottom-left square is a1, and the
              top-right square is h8. Moves are recorded with the piece's
              abbreviation followed by the destination square. For example, Nf3
              means a knight moves to the f3 square.
